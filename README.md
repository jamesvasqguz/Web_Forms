# Web_Forms
A system that allows the creation of web forms through instructions with a structure similar to XML and JSON formats, the idea is to be able to provide the user of the system with a more tailored way so that they can afford to create various types of model forms that can be used to carry out surveys, questionnaires, or any other model that implies the creation of a form.
